## 🔹 About

**Advent of Code** is an annual programming challenge released in December with daily puzzles.  
Each day contains **2 parts**, often requiring creative logic, data structures, or algorithms.  

This repository contains:

- My **Python 3** solutions for each day.
- Structured folders for each day (`DayX`) with `input.txt` and `example.txt`.
- Readable, documented scripts using **docstrings** and type annotations.
- Modular code for reusability across puzzles.
